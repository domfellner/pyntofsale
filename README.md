# pyntofsale
This Python application combines

- a raspberry pi
- a laser scanner
- an item database
- a pos-compliant thermal printer
- a push button to print the current order

into a POS system for a toy shop.

Possible future extensions are:

- a screen to show the current order
- a web interface to analyse the shopping data
